- Because Vino only understand JSON data types, there's an opportunity to enforce more immutability.

- versatile schema that accepts any of the three formats, *primitives*, *array*, or *object*, as well as *null* and *_undef*.

- qualifier syntax to express that *all items* should apply (e.g. '\*', 'all', None)

- need to test for contingencies

- need to test for new namedtuple wrapper
